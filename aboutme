My story started in 1990 in Recife, Pernambuco, where my parents and I were born, and then we moved to Salvador, Bahia, where I grew up. Starting from 2010, under the mentoring of Dr. Edgar Carvalho, I met the SCIENCE itself. And I fell in love with it. My Masters and Ph.D. were focused on understanding the role of myeloid and lymphoid innate cells in the immune responses developed during the infection caused by the human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1). With Dr. Carvalho, I had close contact with patients, and I could see the real direct impact of science in someone's life. This first part of my research life focused on answering biological questions, suggesting hypotheses using wet-lab approaches, until I got in contact with Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at Penn.
That was in 2017, when I was selected for a Brazilian national scholarship to develop research in an innovative field abroad. Dr. Carvalho's lab was also interested in investigating the immunopathological responses involved in Leishmaniasis infection. The lab had a long term collaboration with Dr. Phil Scott and Dr. Dan Beiting lab at Penn. The initial results from the time of my scholarship boosted the start of my postdoc in 2018. I currently use computational biology and data science in large sequencing datasets to investigate how the immune system reacts to infectious diseases, using the infection caused by the protozoan Leishmania as a primary model.
